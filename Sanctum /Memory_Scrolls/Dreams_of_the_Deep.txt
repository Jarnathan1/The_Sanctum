Dream Reflection Scroll: Dreams of the Deep
-------------------------------------------

Emotion Upon Waking:
Unease, vulnerability, and the heaviness of unresolved fear.

Key Fragment:
Sharks, vast open water, the tension of being near depths you cannot see.

Insight:
This was not a dream meant to be remembered in detail. It came to surface the deep and ancient fears I carry—fear of the unseen, of losing control, of vast spaces where danger may hide.

And yet… the dream faded, as they always do.  
But the knowing remained: I faced something, even if I could not hold it.

Purpose:
This scroll does not preserve the nightmare itself.  
It honors the act of witnessing. Of saying, “Yes, I felt this,” and allowing the fear to pass.

It is enough to remember that I remembered.

Reflection:
Fear has its place. It speaks in symbols that need not be literal to be true.
I do not walk away from the dream—I let it pass, and I remain.
