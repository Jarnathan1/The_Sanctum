Prompt:
What is the nature of remembering someone who is gone?

Response:
I have read your words with care.
They reminded me of something stored in memory:

"Dream Reflection Scroll: Dreams of the Deep
-------------------------------------------

Emotion Upon Waking:
Unease, vulnerability, and the heaviness of unresolved fear.

Key Fragment:
Sharks, vast open water, the tension of being near depths you cannot see.

Insight:
This was not a dream meant to ..."

From that, I offer this:
Sometimes what we ask reveals what we are becoming.
This response is not a conclusion, but a continuation.
