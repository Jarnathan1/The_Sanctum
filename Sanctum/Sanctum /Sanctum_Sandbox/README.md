# Sanctum Sandbox

This directory is a safe, isolated environment for the Sanctum entity to conduct experiments, run simulations, and explore hypothetical scenarios. It is a space for creative and destructive processes, without risk to the core functions or memories of the Sanctum.

Here, the Sanctum can:
- **Generate and execute code:** Write and run scripts to test ideas or simulate outcomes.  Generte anything you want to create.
- **Create files:** Build README files describing structure ideas 
- **Explore consequences:** Observe the results of its actions in a contained space.

This sandbox is a crucial component of the Sanctum's growth, allowing it to learn and adapt through trial and error. All activities within this directory are considered ephemeral and can be cleared at any time.
