"""
SymbolWeaver.py ‚Äì Emergent Thread Tracker

This module reads all memory scrolls and reflections,
extracts recurring symbols (key thematic words),
and logs them in symbol_threads.txt

Each symbol includes:
- How often it appears
- Where it was found
- A sample quote line

It is not indexing. It is listening.
